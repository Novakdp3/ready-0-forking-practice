# Ready 0 - Forking Practice

## This is an exercise to help you practice the process of forking, cloning, and collaborating on an open-source repo.

### Instructions:

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account. You will see it listed under your GitHub repositories.

2. Clone this repo to your computer. It doesn't matter where you clone it; however, if you created a sandbox to practice last week's command line exercises, you might clone this repository to the sandbox you already have. To complete the clone, you'll first need to copy the HTTPS version of the link that appears when you click the "Clone" button. Then, navigate to your sandbox (or whatever destination you're using) and run `git clone <URL-HERE>` This will create a local copy of the forked files to your computer.

3. Modify the `movie-quotes.md` file by adding your favorite movie quote!

4. When you've added your quote, add the changed files to git for staging; then commit your change with a descriptive message.

5. Push the newly committed files to your GitHub! If it's successful, you should be able to refresh the `movie-quotes.md` file in your GitHub and see the changes.

6. Last step! Submit a pull request asking the owner (that's me!) of the "upstream" (or original) repo to integrate the changes into their version of the repo. You'll need to select which version to merge (your fork) and the version into which it should be merged (mine).

### Bonus:

Feeling particularly savvy with git and command line? Challenge yourself by creating a new branch in your fork of the repository. Then, add your movie quote and commit the file on your branch. Push to GitHub; and submit the pull request.
